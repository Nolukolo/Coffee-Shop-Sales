revenue and improve product performance. Your role, as a Junior Data Analyst, is to extract
actionable insights from historical data and prepare a presentation to assist the CEO in
decision-making.
2. OBJECTIVE
Use your analytics, SQL, and data visualization skills to help Bright Coffee Shop
understand:
• Which products generate the most revenue

4. TASKS
Task 1: Planning & Architecture (Miro)
Using Miro or any equivalent whiteboard tool:
1. Design a Data Flow & Architecture Diagram that outlines:
• Where the data comes from (source)
• How it is processed (ETL pipeline)
• Where it is stored (Snowflake)
• How it is analyzed and presented
2. List the Key Insights that the team should deliver, such as:
• Sales by product category and time intervals
• High-performing and low-performing products
• Total revenue calculations
3. Outline the calculations to be performed:
• Total Amount = unit_price * transaction_qty
• Grouping by 30-minute time intervals
• Total units sold by product type or detail
You can add on the above, this is just to give you an idea of what is expected from the Miro
planning.
Task 2: Data Processing in Snowflake
1. Convert the provided Excel data to CSV.
2. Load the CSV into Snowflake
3. Perform data transformations:
• Create a new column: transaction_time_bucket to group transactions into 30-
minute intervals (Or it can be 1 hour intervals)
• Cast unit_price properly (some entries use commas, e.g., '3,1' should be converted
to 3.1)

• Compute total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty
• Use SQL to group by product types, time buckets, etc.
You can add on the above, this is just to give you an idea of what is expected from the Data
Processing.
Task 3: Data Analysis in Excel
After processing the data in Snowflake:
1. Export the processed table to Microsoft Excel or your visualization tool
2. Create dashboards or pivot tables showing:
• Total revenue per product type
• Peak time intervals for sales
• Quantity of items sold by product category
• Best-selling product types or details
• Use charts and graphs to make the story visually appealing
