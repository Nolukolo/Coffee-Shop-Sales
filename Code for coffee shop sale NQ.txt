-- This query analyzes Bright Coffee Shop sales data to generate business insights
-- It includes custom time segments, spend bands, and  date fields (month, day name, ISO week)

-- Step 1: Creating the summary table that calculates total transaction value
WITH sales_summary AS (

        (TRANSACTION_QTY * UNIT_PRICE) AS transaction_value -- total sale per transaction
    FROM "Coffee Shop".SHOPS.COFFEESHOPSALES

-- Step 2: Calculating total daily spend per store
store_daily_summary AS (
    SELECT
        STORE_LOCATION,
        TRANSACTION_DATE,
        SUM(transaction_value) AS daily_store_spend -- this helps us classify stores into spend bands
    FROM sales_summary
    GROUP BY STORE_LOCATION, TRANSACTION_DATE
),

-- Step 3: Assign a spend_band to each store-day based on how much was earned
store_spend_band AS (

        STORE_LOCATION,
        TRANSACTION_DATE,
        CASE

            ELSE 'Very High'
        END AS spend_band
    FROM store_daily_summary
)
